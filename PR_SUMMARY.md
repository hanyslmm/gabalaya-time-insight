# Pull Request: Admin Full CRUD with Organization Scoping

## 🎯 Objective

Grant users with `admin` role full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) privileges equivalent to `owner` role, but strictly limited to their own organization only.

## 📋 Changes Summary

### Database Changes (Migration: `20250126000000_admin_full_crud_org_scoped.sql`)

#### Helper Functions Created
- `is_owner()` - Check if current user is an owner
- `is_admin()` - Check if current user is an admin
- `current_user_organization_id()` - Get current user's organization ID
- `is_admin_or_owner()` - Check if user has full CRUD privileges

#### RLS Policies Updated (9 Tables)

1. **admin_users** - Admins can manage users in their org
2. **organizations** - Admins can view/update their org (cannot create new orgs)
3. **employees** - Full CRUD for admins in their org
4. **timesheet_entries** - Full CRUD for admins in their org
5. **timesheet_change_requests** - Full CRUD for admins in their org
6. **wage_settings** - Full CRUD for admins in their org
7. **company_settings** - Full CRUD for admins in their org
8. **employee_roles** - Full CRUD for admins in their org
9. **owner_organization_access** - Owners only (no change)

### Frontend Changes

#### `src/components/OrganizationManagement.tsx`
- ✅ Now accessible to both owners and admins

- ✅ RLS policies enforce data isolation

#### `src/components/AdminRoleChange.tsx`
- ✅ Now accessible to owners and admins
- ✅ Admins can change user roles in their organization
- ✅ RLS policies prevent cross-organization modifications

- Tests RLS policies, helper functions, data isolation
- Verification queries
- Cleanup scripts

## 🔒 Security Model

### Owner (Global Access)
```
✓ Access ALL organizations
✓ Create/delete organizations
✓ Manage users across ALL organizations
✓ Platform-level administration
```

### Admin (Organization-Scoped)
```
✓ Full CRUD in THEIR organization ONLY
✗ Cannot see other organizations
✗ Cannot create new organizations
✗ Cannot manage users in other organizations
```

### Employee (Read-Only)
```
✓ View their own data
✗ Cannot modify other users' data
✗ Cannot manage organization
```

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Run Migration

```bash
# Apply migration
cd supabase/migrations
psql -h [host] -U [user] -d [database] -f 20250126000000_admin_full_crud_org_scoped.sql

# Or use Supabase CLI
supabase db push
```

### Step 2: Run Test Script

```bash
psql -h [host] -U [user] -d [database] -f test_admin_crud_permissions.sql
```

Expected output:
- ✅ All helper functions work
- ✅ RLS enabled on all tables
- ✅ All CRUD policies exist
- ✅ Test data created successfully

### Step 3: Manual Testing

#### Test Admin Access (Should See Only Their Org)

1. Login as admin user (e.g., `marwa_user`)
2. Navigate to Dashboard - Should see only their org data
3. Go to Employees page - Should see only employees in their org
4. Go to Timesheets page - Should see only timesheets for their org
5. Try to create/edit/delete employee - Should succeed for their org
6. Go to Settings - Should only see settings for their org

#### Test Organization Isolation

1. Create 2 test organizations
2. Create 2 admin users (one for each org)
3. Create employees in each organization
4. Login as Admin 1:
   - Should ONLY see Org 1 employees
   - Should NOT see Org 2 employees
   - Should be able to manage Org 1 data
5. Login as Admin 2:
   - Should ONLY see Org 2 employees
   - Should NOT see Org 1 employees
   - Should be able to manage Org 2 data

#### Test Owner Access (Should See Everything)

1. Login as owner user
2. Should see ALL organizations
3. Should see ALL employees across all organizations
4. Should be able to create new organizations
5. Should be able to manage users in any organization

### Step 4: Verify Database-Level Security

```sql
-- As admin user from Org 1
SET request.jwt.claims.username = 'admin_from_org1';
SELECT * FROM employees; 
-- Should only return employees from Org 1

-- As owner
SET request.jwt.claims.username = 'owner';
SELECT * FROM employees;
-- Should return ALL employees from ALL organizations
```

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Admins can CREATE employees in their organization
- [ ] Admins can READ all data in their organization
- [ ] Admins can UPDATE data in their organization
- [ ] Admins can DELETE data in their organization
- [ ] Admins CANNOT see data from other organizations
- [ ] Owners still have global access to everything
- [ ] All existing functionality works as before

### Security Requirements
- [ ] Data isolation enforced at database level (RLS)
- [ ] Cross-organization access attempts fail
- [ ] JWT claims properly validated
- [ ] All tables have RLS enabled
- [ ] All helper functions work correctly

### UI/UX Requirements

## 📊 Impact Analysis

### Breaking Changes
❌ **NONE** - This is purely additive. Existing owner functionality is unchanged.

### Database Performance
✅ **MINIMAL IMPACT** - Helper functions use SECURITY DEFINER and are optimized with STABLE flag

### Frontend Performance
✅ **NO IMPACT** - Only conditional rendering changes, no new queries

### User Experience
✅ **IMPROVED** - Admins now have more autonomy and can manage their organization independently

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

If issues occur after deployment:

1. **Immediate Rollback**:
   ```sql
   -- Make policies permissive temporarily
   DROP POLICY ALL ON [affected_table];
   CREATE POLICY "temp_allow_all" ON [table] FOR ALL USING (true);
   ```

2. **Complete Rollback**:
   - Revert to previous migration
   - Restore previous policies
   - Verify data integrity

3. **Data Verification**:
   ```sql
   -- Check no data was lost/corrupted
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees;
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM timesheet_entries;
   ```

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

1. **Pre-Deployment**:
   - ✅ Backup database
   - ✅ Review changes with team
   - ✅ Test in staging environment
   - ✅ Prepare rollback plan

2. **Deployment**:
   - ✅ Apply migration
   - ✅ Run test script
   - ✅ Verify RLS policies
   - ✅ Test with real admin user

3. **Post-Deployment**:
   - ✅ Monitor for errors
   - ✅ Verify data isolation
   - ✅ Test all CRUD operations
   - ✅ Gather user feedback
