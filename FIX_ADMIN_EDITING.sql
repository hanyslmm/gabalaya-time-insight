-- FIX: Admin User Editing Issue
-- The problem: Frontend tries to update 'employees' table for admin users
-- But admin users are in 'admin_users' table, not 'employees' table
-- ============================================================================

-- Step 1: Check if the user being edited is in admin_users table
SELECT 
  'CHECKING ADMIN USER' as status,
  au.id,
  au.username,
  au.full_name,
  au.role,
  o.name as organization
FROM admin_users au
LEFT JOIN organizations o ON o.id = au.organization_id
WHERE au.username = 'EMP085382' OR au.id = 'cfe7d011-1fa4-4266-ba80-7b24041e2ed0';

-- Step 2: Check if there's a corresponding employee record
SELECT 
  'CHECKING EMPLOYEE RECORD' as status,
  e.id,
  e.staff_id,
  e.full_name,
  e.role,
  o.name as organization
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN organizations o ON o.id = e.organization_id
WHERE e.staff_id = 'EMP085382' OR e.id = 'cfe7d011-1fa4-4266-ba80-7b24041e2ed0';

-- Step 3: The issue is that the frontend is trying to update the employees table
-- But admin users should be updated in the admin_users table instead

-- Step 4: Check what columns exist in admin_users table
SELECT 
  'ADMIN_USERS COLUMNS' as status,
  column_name,
  data_type,
  is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'admin_users' 
ORDER BY ordinal_position;

-- Step 5: Check what columns exist in employees table
SELECT 
  'EMPLOYEES COLUMNS' as status,
  column_name,
  data_type,
  is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'employees' 
ORDER BY ordinal_position;

-- Step 6: The solution is to modify the frontend to:
-- 1. Check if user is admin (is_admin_user = true)
-- 2. If admin, update admin_users table instead of employees table
-- 3. Handle the different column structure
