# Timesheet Tabs and Dropdown Menu Fixes

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Timesheet Tab Display Issues
- **Problem**: Timesheet data not displaying correctly, filtering issues
- **Root Cause**: Incomplete filtering logic and poor error handling in `useTimesheetTable` hook
- **Solution**: Enhanced filtering logic with proper null/undefined handling and error boundaries

### 2. Dropdown Menu Filtering Issues
- **Problem**: Dropdown menus not properly adapting page content when filters are selected
- **Root Cause**: Lack of proper state management and visual feedback for filtering
- **Solution**: Enhanced `MobileDropdownTabs` component with better state management and visual indicators

### 3. Page Adaptation Issues
- **Problem**: Page content not updating properly when filters are applied
- **Root Cause**: Missing callbacks and state synchronization between components
- **Solution**: Added proper callback handling and state management throughout the component hierarchy
