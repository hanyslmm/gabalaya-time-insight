### Step 3: Fix marwa_user Role (1 minute)

1. **Create Another New Query**
   - Click **"New Query"** again

2. **Copy and Run User Fix**
   
```sql
-- Fix marwa_user to have admin role
DO $$
DECLARE
  org_id UUID;
  emp_name TEXT;
BEGIN
  -- Get organization_id from employees table or use first org
  SELECT organization_id, full_name INTO org_id, emp_name
  FROM employees 
  WHERE staff_id = 'marwa_user'
  LIMIT 1;
  
  IF org_id IS NULL THEN
    -- Get first available organization
    SELECT id INTO org_id FROM organizations LIMIT 1;
  END IF;
  
  -- Update or insert marwa_user with admin role
  INSERT INTO admin_users (username, password_hash, full_name, role, organization_id)
  VALUES (
    'marwa_user', 
    'marwa123',
    COALESCE(emp_name, 'Marwa'), 
    'admin', 
    org_id
  )
  ON CONFLICT (username) DO UPDATE SET 
    role = 'admin',
    organization_id = COALESCE(EXCLUDED.organization_id, admin_users.organization_id),
    updated_at = NOW();
  
  RAISE NOTICE 'marwa_user set to admin role in organization: %', org_id;
END $$;

-- Verify
SELECT username, role, organization_id, full_name 
FROM admin_users 
WHERE username = 'marwa_user';
```

3. **Click "RUN"**

**Expected Output:**
```
username     | role  | organization_id | full_name
marwa_user   | admin | [some-uuid]    | Marwa
```

---

### Step 4: Logout and Login (1 minute)

1. **In your app** (http://localhost:8080):
   - Click "Profile" or user menu
   - Click **"Logout"**

2. **Hard refresh** browser:
   - Mac: **Cmd + Shift + R**
   - Windows/Linux: **Ctrl + Shift + R**

3. **Login again**:
   - Username: `marwa_user`
   - Password: `marwa123` (or your current password)

---

## ✅ Verify Success

After logging in, you should see:

### In Sidebar:
- ✅ **Badge**: "Admin" (orange, NOT "Employee" blue)
- ✅ **Dashboard** menu
- ✅ **Employees** menu (NEW!)
- ✅ **Timesheets** menu  
- ✅ **Settings** menu (NEW!)

### Test It:
1. Click **"Employees"** → Should see employee list
2. Click **"Add Employee"** → Should work!
3. Edit an employee → Should work!
4. Go to **"Timesheets"** → Should see all org data

---

## 🔍 Quick Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still getting "column does not exist" error in Step 2

**Solution**: 
```sql
-- Run this diagnostic query first:
SELECT table_name, column_name 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND column_name = 'organization_id'
ORDER BY table_name;

-- Should return at least these tables:
-- admin_users, employees, timesheet_entries, wage_settings, company_settings
```

If any are missing, run Step 1 again.

---

### Issue: marwa_user still shows "Employee" after logout/login

**Solution A**: Clear browser cache completely
- Chrome: Ctrl+Shift+Delete → Clear browsing data
- Or use Incognito/Private mode

**Solution B**: Double-check role in database
```sql
SELECT username, role, organization_id 
FROM admin_users 
WHERE username = 'marwa_user';

-- If role != 'admin', run Step 3 SQL again
```

---

### Issue: Can't see any employees after getting admin access

**Solution**: Check organization assignment
```sql
-- See what org marwa_user is in:
SELECT 
  au.username,
  au.role,
  o.name as org_name,
  COUNT(e.id) as employee_count
FROM admin_users au
LEFT JOIN organizations o ON o.id = au.organization_id
LEFT JOIN employees e ON e.organization_id = au.organization_id
WHERE au.username = 'marwa_user'
GROUP BY au.username, au.role, o.name;

-- If employee_count = 0, assign some employees to your org:
UPDATE employees 
SET organization_id = (
  SELECT organization_id FROM admin_users WHERE username = 'marwa_user'
)
WHERE organization_id IS NULL OR organization_id != (
  SELECT organization_id FROM admin_users WHERE username = 'marwa_user'
);
```

WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND column_name = 'organization_id';
-- Should be >= 5

-- 2. Check helper functions exist  
SELECT 'Functions check:' as test;
SELECT COUNT(*) as function_count 
FROM information_schema.routines
