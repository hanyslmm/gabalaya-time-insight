## 🎯 STEP 2: Fix marwa_user Admin Role (1 minute)

### Run this SQL in Supabase Dashboard:

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/npmniesphobtsoftczeh/sql
2. Click "New Query"
3. Copy and paste this SQL:

```sql
-- Fix marwa_user to have admin role
DO $$
DECLARE
  org_id UUID;
  emp_id UUID;
  emp_name TEXT;
BEGIN
  -- Get organization_id from employees table
  SELECT organization_id, id, full_name INTO org_id, emp_id, emp_name
  FROM employees 
  WHERE staff_id = 'marwa_user'
  LIMIT 1;
  
  IF org_id IS NULL THEN
    -- If not found, try to get Science Club org
    SELECT id INTO org_id
    FROM organizations
    WHERE name = 'Science Club'
    LIMIT 1;
  END IF;
  
  -- Update or insert marwa_user in admin_users table with admin role
  INSERT INTO admin_users (username, password_hash, full_name, role, organization_id)
  VALUES (
    'marwa_user', 
    'marwa123', -- You can change this password
    COALESCE(emp_name, 'Marwa'), 
    'admin', 
    org_id
  )
  ON CONFLICT (username) DO UPDATE SET 
    role = 'admin',
    organization_id = COALESCE(EXCLUDED.organization_id, admin_users.organization_id),
    full_name = COALESCE(EXCLUDED.full_name, admin_users.full_name),
    updated_at = NOW();
  
  RAISE NOTICE 'marwa_user updated with admin role';
END $$;

-- Verify it worked
SELECT username, role, organization_id, full_name 
FROM admin_users 
WHERE username = 'marwa_user';
```

4. Click **"RUN"**
5. You should see output showing marwa_user with role='admin'

---

## 🎯 STEP 3: Logout and Login Again (1 minute)

### Clear your session and get a fresh token:

1. **In the app (http://localhost:8080)**:
   - Click on "Profile" or your user menu
   - Click "Logout"

2. **Clear cache** (Optional but recommended):
   - Press Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux)
   - This does a hard refresh

3. **Login again**:
   - Username: `marwa_user`
   - Password: (your password, or `marwa123` if you used the SQL above)

---

## ✅ Verify It Works

After logging in as marwa_user, you should now see:

### ✅ In the Sidebar Navigation:
- Dashboard (with stats and charts)
- Clock In/Out
- My Timesheet
- **Employees** ← NEW! (Create/Edit/Delete employees)
- **Timesheets** ← NEW! (View all org timesheets)
- **Settings** ← NEW! (Configure organization settings)
- Profile

### ✅ At Bottom of Sidebar:
- Badge should show: **"Admin"** (orange badge)
- NOT "Employee" anymore

### ✅ Try These Actions:
1. Click "Employees" → You should see employee list
2. Click "Add Employee" → Should be able to create new employee
3. Click on an employee → Should be able to edit
4. Go to Timesheets → Should see all timesheets in your organization
5. Go to Settings → Should be able to modify settings

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Still seeing "Employee" after logout/login

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Run this query to check marwa_user role:
SELECT username, role FROM admin_users WHERE username = 'marwa_user';

-- If no results or role != 'admin', run Step 2 SQL again
```

### Issue 2: "Permission denied" errors when trying to access data

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Verify RLS policies were created:
SELECT policyname, tablename 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
  AND (policyname LIKE '%Admins%' OR policyname LIKE '%admin%')
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;

-- Should see many policies with "Admins can..." names
-- If empty, run Step 1 migration again
```

### Issue 3: Can see "Employees" menu but get errors when clicking

**Possible causes:**
1. RLS migration not applied → Go back to Step 1
2. Organization_id is NULL → Run this fix:

```sql
-- Fix NULL organization_id for marwa_user
UPDATE admin_users 
SET organization_id = (
  SELECT id FROM organizations WHERE name = 'Science Club' LIMIT 1
)
WHERE username = 'marwa_user' AND organization_id IS NULL;
```

### Issue 4: Can't login after changing role to admin

**Solution:**
- Try password: `marwa123` (default from SQL script)
- OR reset it:
```sql
UPDATE admin_users 
SET password_hash = 'your_password_here'
WHERE username = 'marwa_user';
```

## 🆘 Still Not Working?

### Quick Diagnostic Query

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor to get full diagnostic info:

```sql
-- Comprehensive diagnostic
SELECT 'marwa_user in admin_users:' as check;
SELECT username, role, organization_id, full_name FROM admin_users WHERE username = 'marwa_user';

SELECT 'marwa_user in employees:' as check;
SELECT staff_id, full_name, role, organization_id FROM employees WHERE staff_id = 'marwa_user';

SELECT 'RLS policies created:' as check;
SELECT COUNT(*) as policy_count 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
  AND (policyname LIKE '%Admins%' OR policyname LIKE '%admin%');

SELECT 'Helper functions exist:' as check;
SELECT COUNT(*) as function_count 
FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_schema = 'public' 
  AND routine_name IN ('is_owner', 'is_admin', 'current_user_organization_id');
```

**Expected Results:**
- marwa_user in admin_users: 1 row with role='admin'
- marwa_user in employees: 0 or 1 row (doesn't matter)
- RLS policies: Should be > 20
- Helper functions: Should be 3 or 4

### Share Results

If still having issues:
1. Run the diagnostic query above
2. Take a screenshot of the results
3. Share with the team for assistance

## 🎉 Success!

Once you see the "Admin" badge and can access all admin features, you're all set! 

You now have full CRUD access to:
- ✅ Employees in your organization
- ✅ Timesheets in your organization
- ✅ Company settings for your organization
- ✅ User management in your organization
- ✅ All admin features (scoped to your organization)

**Important**: You can only see and manage data for the "Science Club" organization (or whichever org marwa_user is assigned to). This is intentional for security and data isolation.
