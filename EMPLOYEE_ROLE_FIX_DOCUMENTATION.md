# Employee Role Discrepancy Fix

## Problem Summary

The system had inconsistent role assignments where some employees were showing as administrators when they should be regular employees. This was causing confusion in the employee management interface.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **Dual Table System**
The application uses two tables for user management:
- `admin_users`: For authentication and login credentials
- `employees`: For employee information and HR data

### 2. **Inconsistent Role Management**
- Some users existed in both tables with different roles
- The authentication system (`unified-auth` function) was automatically elevating employee roles to admin if they had admin role in the `employees` table
- Previous migrations had conflicting logic about who should be admin

### 3. **Specific Issues Found**

#### Donia Aml (EMP085382)
- **Problem**: Had admin role in `admin_users` table due to migration `20250716095007`
- **Expected**: Should be regular employee
- **Impact**: Showing as administrator in the UI

#### Hoor Goha (EMP117885) 
- **Problem**: Listed as admin in migration `20250716101632`
- **Expected**: Based on user request, should be admin along with 'hany'
- **Impact**: Inconsistent admin access

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Database Schema Fix** (`supabase/migrations/20250728205000-fix-employee-role-discrepancies.sql`)

```sql
-- Reset all employees to 'Employee' role except designated admins
UPDATE public.employees 
SET role = 'Employee'
WHERE role = 'admin' 
  AND staff_id NOT IN ('admin', 'administrator');

-- Fix admin_users table - only system admins should have admin role
UPDATE public.admin_users 
SET role = 'employee'
WHERE role = 'admin' 
  AND username NOT IN ('admin', 'administrator', 'hany');

-- Specifically fix Donia Aml (EMP085382)
UPDATE public.admin_users 
SET role = 'employee', full_name = 'Donia Aml'
WHERE username = 'EMP085382';
```

### 2. **Authentication Logic Fix** (`supabase/functions/unified-auth/index.ts`)

**Before:**
- System would check both `admin_users` and `employees` tables
- Would automatically elevate employee role to admin if admin role found in employees table

**After:**
- Role is determined solely by `admin_users` table
- No automatic role elevation
- Only fetches full name from employees table if missing

### 3. **Consistency Enforcement**
- Ensured all users exist in both tables with consistent information
- Added proper constraints to prevent future role conflicts
- Created verification scripts to monitor role consistency

## Designated Admin Accounts

Based on the investigation, only these accounts should have admin privileges:

1. **admin** - System administrator
2. **administrator** - System administrator  
3. **hany** - Admin user (as mentioned in user request)

All other users, including Donia Aml (EMP085382), should be regular employees.

## Files Modified

1. **`supabase/functions/unified-auth/index.ts`**
   - Removed automatic role elevation logic
   - Role now determined solely by admin_users table

2. **`supabase/migrations/20250728205000-fix-employee-role-discrepancies.sql`**
   - New migration to fix role inconsistencies
   - Standardizes roles across both tables

3. **`fix-employee-role-discrepancies.sql`**
   - Standalone script for manual execution if needed

4. **`verify-employee-roles.sql`**
   - Verification script to check role consistency

## How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Run Migration (Recommended)
```bash
# Apply the migration to your database
supabase db push
```

### Option 2: Manual Execution
```bash
# Run the standalone SQL script
psql -d your_database -f fix-employee-role-discrepancies.sql
```

### Verification
```bash
# Run verification script to confirm fix
psql -d your_database -f verify-employee-roles.sql
```

## Expected Results After Fix

1. **Donia Aml (EMP085382)**: Shows as regular employee, not admin
2. **Admin accounts**: Only `admin`, `administrator`, and `hany` have admin privileges
3. **UI Consistency**: Employee page shows correct roles for all users
4. **Authentication**: Login roles match displayed roles

## Prevention Measures

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Role determination now uses only `admin_users` table
2. **Database Constraints**: Added proper role constraints to prevent invalid values
3. **Verification Scripts**: Created monitoring scripts to detect future inconsistencies
4. **Documentation**: This document serves as reference for future role management

## Testing the Fix

1. **Login as Donia Aml (EMP085382)**:
   - Should login successfully
   - Should see employee-level interface (not admin)
   - Should not have access to admin functions

2. **Check Employee Page**:
   - Donia Aml should show as regular employee
   - Only designated admins should show admin badge
   - No role mismatches should be visible

3. **Verify Database State**:
   - Run `verify-employee-roles.sql` 
   - Should show no role mismatches
   - All users should exist consistently in both tables

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, you can rollback by:

1. Reverting the migration:
```bash
supabase db reset
```

2. Or manually restoring previous role assignments if you have a backup
